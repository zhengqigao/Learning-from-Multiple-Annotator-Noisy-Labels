## Instructions

We have provided one set of generated MNIST data in Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RTF9TJMZ-OZm1-oX5mVuslD-P1VOZqOU?usp=sharing. It corresponds to epsilon=34 in Table 1 of our paper. 

Please directly download the source data, and unzip and put it under this ./data folder. You should see a tree structure looks like:


|-- data

        |-- train

            |-- data_1.pt, label_1.pt ...

        |-- test
